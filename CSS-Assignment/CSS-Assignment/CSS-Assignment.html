        <h3>(2) What are the disadvantages of CSS? 
        </h3>

        <p>
            CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating of confusion among  web browsers. <br>
            With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The web developers need to test for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.
            There exists a scarcity of security. <br>
            After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. The similar change affects on all the browsers. <br>
            The programming language world is complicated for non-developers and beginners. <br>




            Learning Curve <br>
Lack of Security <br>
Limited Layout Control <br>
Performance Impact <br>
Overriding Styles <br>

        <h3>(3)What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3? 
        </h3>

        <p>CSS3 is split into many various documents known as Modules. each module adds new capability or extends options outlined in CSS2 over conserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS3 started around the time of publication of the initial CSS2 recommendation. The CSS3 version supports more browsers than CSS2.14-May-2019
        </p>
        <p>CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle. With CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast.</p>

    <h3>(10) Why should background and color be used as separate properties? 
    </h3>

    
        <p>
            1. Legibility
            <br>
            The background property is a complex property that controls the background of an element, including the background color, background image, and background position. If the color property was combined with the background property, it would make the background property even more complex and difficult to read and understand.
            <br>
            2. Inheritance
            <br>
            The color property is inherited by child elements, while the background property is not. This means that if the color property was combined with the background property, it would be difficult to control the color of child elements independently of the background color of their parent elements.

<h3>(12)How to maintain the CSS specifications? </h3>
<p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Even though every browser supports CSS, there are many inconsistencies in the supported specification version. Some browsers even have their own implementation of the specification and have proprietary (vendor) prefixes.</p>

<p>The Specification defines how CSS properties should be implemented by browser vendors along with detailed algorithms, code samples and tabular information. </p>

<h3>(13)What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page? </h3>
<p>CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use Inline CSS in a style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an internal stylesheet. We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML.</p>

<b>Inline CSS:</b> Inline CSS is the simplest way to add CSS to a web page. To use inline CSS, simply add the style attribute to an HTML element and set the value of the style attribute to the desired CSS properties.

<p style="color: chartreuse;">Inline-Css</p>
<br>
<b>Internal CSS:</b> Internal CSS is another way to add CSS to a web page. To use internal CSS, create a (style) element in the head section of your HTML document and add your CSS code to the style element. 

<p class="pera">internal-css</p>
<style>

.pera{ color: blue;}
</style>

<br>
<b>External CSS:</b> External CSS is the preferred way to add CSS to a web page. To use external CSS, create a CSS file with the .css extension and add your CSS code to the CSS file. Then, in the (head) section of your HTML document, add a (link) element to the CSS file. 

<p>External-css</p>
<p><link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"></p>


<h3>(14) What is embedded style sheets? </h3>

<p>An embedded style sheet is declared within the <head> element of an XHTML document. It applies to the whole document, rather than just one element. Each style declaration (or CSS rule) gets applied to everything in the document that matches that rule</p>

    <p> style sheets come in three types, external, internal, and inline. External ones have their own file and apply to every web page that includes them. Internal ones apply to the whole document, but you have to put them at the top of the page in the header.</p>

   <p>Internal style sheet. Internal style sheet known as embedded style sheet</p>

   <p> Embedded style sheets are useful for styling a single HTML document or for applying unique styles to a specific subset of elements within a document. They are also useful for overriding styles that are defined in external CSS style sheets.
</p>


<h3>(15)What are the external style sheets?</h3>


<p>
    To add external CSS in HTML we use the <link> tag. We use the rel attribute to specify the relationship between the linked document and the HTML file. We use the src attribute to write the location(URL) of the CSS file. The type attribute is optional and is used to specify the type of the linked file.</p>
<p>
    External style sheets are CSS style sheets that are saved as separate files with the .css extension. They are linked to HTML documents using the (link) element in the head section of the document.
    <br>
    External style sheets are the preferred way to add CSS to a web page because they offer a number of advantages over inline and embedded style sheets
</p>

<p><link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"></p> add extranal style sheet by link

<h3>(16) What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets? </h3>

<p>advantages</p>
<p>Using them, the styles of multiple documents can be controlled from one file. <br>
    Classes can be created for use on multiple HTML element types in many  <br>
    In complex situations, selector and grouping methods can be used to apply styles. <br>
    easy to link style sheet <br>
    it is vary faster work to use with selectors extrnal style sheet
    </p>
<p>disadvantages</p>
<p>Your pages may not be rendered correctly until the external CSS is loaded. <br>
    Uploading or linking to multiple CSS files can increase your site's download time.</p>


    <h3>(17)What is the meaning of the CSS selector? </h3>

   <p> CSS selectors are used to select the HTML elements that you want to style.
    <br>
<b>Simple selectors:</b> Simple selectors match HTML elements based on their tag name, class name, or ID.
<br>
<b>Combinator selectors:</b> Combinator selectors match HTML elements based on their relationship to other HTML elements.
<br>
<b>Pseudo-class selectors:</b> Pseudo-class selectors match HTML elements based on their state, such as being hovered over or focused.
<br>
<b>Pseudo-element selectors:</b> Pseudo-element selectors match parts of HTML elements, such as the first letter of a paragraph or the link state of an anchor element.
<br>
<b>Attribute selectors:</b> Attribute selectors match HTML elements based on their attributes.
</p>

<h3>(18) What are the media types allowed by CSS? </h3>

<p>One of the most important features of style sheets is that they specify how a document is to be presented on different media: on the screen, on paper, with a speech synthesizer, with a braille device, etc. We have currently two ways to specify media dependencies for style sheets −</p>

<p>
    <b>all:</b> This is the default media type and applies to all devices and environments.
    <br>
    <b>aural:</b> This media type applies to devices that produce audio output, such as screen readers and speech synthesizers.
    <br>
    <b>braille:</b> This media type applies to devices that produce braille output, such as braille embossers.
        <br>
    <b>handheld:</b> This media type applies to handheld devices, such as smartphones and tablets.
        <br>
    <b>print:</b> This media type applies to printed documents.
        <br>
    <b>projection:</b> This media type applies to projected presentations, such as those displayed on screens or projectors.
        <br>
    <b>screen:</b> This media type applies to devices with screens, such as computers and smartphones.
        <br>
    <b>tty:</b> This media type applies to devices with teletype (TTY) interfaces.
        <br>
    <b>tv:</b> This media type applies to television devices.
    </p>

    <h3>(19) What is the rule set? </h3>

    <p>A CSS rule set contains one or more selectors and one or more declarations. The selector(s), which in this example is h1 , points to an HTML element. The declaration(s), which in this example are color: blue and text-align: center style the element with a property and value.</p>

    <p>A CSS rule consists of two main parts: selector ('h1') and declaration ('color: red'). In HTML, element names are case-insensitive so 'h1' works just as well as 'H1</p>
